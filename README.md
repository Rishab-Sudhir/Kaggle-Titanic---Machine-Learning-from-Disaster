# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning models. It is a part of the Kaggle competition titled "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". 
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that detail the process of exploring, preprocessing, and modeling the Titanic dataset.

## Notebooks
- `Titanic_ML_Notebook.ipynb`: This notebook contains the initial exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and the building of machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- `Titanic_ML_Notebook_2.ipynb`: This notebook expands upon the first, with extra machine learning models like Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes and a few more advanced techniques like dimensionality reduction, ensemble methods, and model evaluation to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Running the Project
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to access the notebooks.
